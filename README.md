# Copernicus Processing Service (CopPro)

This Project aims to provide an easy way for users of Copernicus Sentinel Data to request corrected Data by requesting an OGC Web Processing Service (WPS).

In addition to a basic dowloading and performing athmospheric- trrain and cirrus correction this service will provide other tools to produce Level 2B Data Product.
